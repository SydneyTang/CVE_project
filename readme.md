# Argus Web App ðŸš—ðŸ‘€

## Overview
**Argus Web App** is a Streamlit-based web application designed for vehicle damage detection and time estimation. Users can upload images of car damage, and the app provides insights into dents, scratches, tire issues, and windshield damage. Each detection type is powered by dedicated image processing algorithms.

---

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format.
- **Damage Detection Options**:
  - **Dents**: Detect and highlight dents on the vehicle.
  - **Scratches**: Identify scratches on the car, with special options for white cars.
  - **Tires**: Detect flat tires and estimate time for repair.
  - **Windshield**: Identify shattered or damaged windshield glass.
- **Interactive Sidebar**: Choose specific detection methods through a sidebar menu.
- **Real-time Processing**: View processed images with detected damage areas highlighted.

## Usage
1. **Upload an Image**:
   - Drag and drop an image of your vehicle's damage or use the file uploader to select an image.
2. **Select Damage Detection**:
   - Use the sidebar to choose the type of damage to detect:
     - `Dent`
     - `Scratch`
     - `Tire`
     - `Windshield`
3. **View Results**:
   - The processed image will be displayed with highlighted damage areas.
   - Additional messages provide estimated repair time or indicate no damage detected.
